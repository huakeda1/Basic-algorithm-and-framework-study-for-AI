# Recursion application
We finish the following functions by the way of recursion, the core of recursion is that current part is assumed to have been processed, then we think how to put them together.  
1) permutation

2) merge_sort

3) quick sort

4) remove_duplicate

5) flatten_tuple_expression

6) get_edit_distance
