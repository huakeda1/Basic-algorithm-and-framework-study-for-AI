# Graph search problem study

The following three problems are solved by the same graph searching method(breadth first search and depth first search):  
1) Iterate through all restaurants and find the shortest path between the start point and end point.  
2) Pick up and pour water back and forth so as to get specific volume by two cups of known volume.  
3) Search through the subway station map obtained by crawler and find the shortest path or the least transfering path between the start station and the final station.    

## Subway path planning model structure
The figure below shows the architecture of the subway path planning model:
